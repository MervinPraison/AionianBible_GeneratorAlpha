The good news is that the website is the App.  You simply need to book mark <a href='/' title='www.AionianBible.org'>www.AionianBible.org</a> in Safari on your iPhone and you will have quick access to the  <span class='notranslate'>Aionian</span>  Bible.  The Android App actually just opens the website in the browser.  So Apple iOS users can get the same easy access by simply bookmarking the website.</p>
