<p>Who has the authority to interpret the Bible and examine the underlying Hebrew and Greek words?  That is a good question!  We read in  <a href='/Bibles/English---Aionian-Bible/1-John/2'>1 John 2:27</a>,  <i>"As for you, the anointing which you received from him remains in you, and you do not need for anyone to teach you. But as his anointing teaches you concerning all things, and is true, and is no lie, and even as it taught you, you remain in him."</i>  Every Christian is qualified to interpret the Bible!  Now that does not mean we will all agree.  Each of us is still growing in our understanding of the truth.  However, it does mean that there is no infallible human or tradition to answer all our questions.  Instead the Holy Spirit helps each of us to know the truth and grow closer to God and each other.</p>

<p>The Bible is a library with 66 books in the Protestant Canon. The best way to learn God’s word is to read entire books. Read the book of <a href='/Bibles/English---Aionian-Bible/Genesis'>Genesis</a>. Read the book of <a href='/Bibles/English---Aionian-Bible/John'>John</a>. Read the entire Bible library. Topical studies and cross-referencing can be good. However, the safest way to understand context and meaning is to read whole Bible books. Chapter and verse numbers were added for convenience in the 16th century, but unfortunately they can cause the Bible to seem like an encyclopedia. The Aionian Bible is formatted with simple verse numbering, minimal notes, and no cross-referencing in order to encourage the reading of Bible books.</p>

<p>Bible reading must also begin with prayer.  Any Christian is qualified to interpret the Bible with God’s help.  However, this freedom is also a responsibility because without the Holy Spirit we cannot interpret accurately.  We read in  <a href='/Bibles/English---Aionian-Bible/1-Corinthians/2'>1 Corinthians 2:13-14</a>,  <i>"And we speak of these things, not with words taught by human wisdom, but with those taught by the Spirit, comparing spiritual things with spiritual things. Now the natural person does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him, and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually discerned."</i>  So we cannot understand in our natural self, but we can with God’s help through prayer.</p>

<p>The Holy Spirit is the best writer and he uses literary devices such as introductions, conclusions, paragraphs, and metaphors.  He also writes various genres including historical narrative, prose, and poetry.  So Bible study must spiritually discern and understand literature.  Pray, read, observe, interpret, and apply.  Finally, <i>"Do your best to present yourself approved by God, a worker who does not need to be ashamed, properly handling the word of truth."</i>  <a href='/Bibles/English---Aionian-Bible/2-Timothy/2'>2 Timothy 2:15</a>.  <i>"God has granted to us his precious and exceedingly great promises; that through these you may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped from the corruption that is in the world by lust. Yes, and for this very cause adding on your part all diligence, in your faith supply moral excellence; and in moral excellence, knowledge; and in knowledge, self-control; and in self-control patience; and in patience godliness; and in godliness brotherly affection; and in brotherly affection, love. For if these things are yours and abound, they make you to be not idle nor unfruitful to the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.</i> <a href='/Bibles/English---Aionian-Bible/2-Peter/1'>2 Peter 1:4-8</a>.</p>
