<h2 class='center'>Cool Cup</h2>

<p>All AionianBible.org profits are donated to the <i>CoolCup.org</i> water project. So many in this world do not have clean drinking water and safe wastewater disposal. This project sponsors new and existing efforts to provide the needy with water in Jesus' name.</p>

<p>Apostle John records that Jesus asked the woman at the well for a cup of water in Samaria in <a href='/Bibles/English---Aionian-Bible/John/4' title='John chapter 4' onclick='return AionianBible_Makemark("/Bibles","/John/4");'>John chapter 4</a>. Jesus then spoke the truth in love to that woman and gave her <i>"springs of water that welled up to consummate life."</i> She then persuaded the whole town to believe and confess that Jesus is the Christ, the Savior of the world. Jesus also said in <a href='/Bibles/English---Aionian-Bible/Mark/9' title='Mark 9:41' onclick='return AionianBible_Makemark("/Bibles","/Mark/9");'>Mark 9:41</a>, <i>"For whoever will give you a cup of water to drink in my name because you are Christâ€™s, most certainly I tell you, he will in no way lose his reward."</i> Jesus is a cool cup of water for thirsty people.</p>
