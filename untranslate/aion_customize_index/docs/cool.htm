<h2 class='center'>Cool Cup</h2>

<p>All AionianBible.org profits are donated to the <i>CoolCup.org</i> water project. So many in this world do not have clean drinking water and safe wastewater disposal. This project sponsors new and existing efforts to provide the needy with water in Jesus' name.</p>

<p>Apostle John records the story of Jesus and the woman at the well in Samaria in <a href='/Bibles/English---Aionian-Bible/John/4' title='John chapter 4' onclick='return AionianBible_Makemark("/Bibles","/John/4");'>John chapter 4</a>. Jesus spoke the truh in love to that woman and brought <i>"springs of water that welled up to consummate life."</i> Through her testimony the whole town believed and confessed that Jesus is the Christ, the Savior of the world. Jesus also said in <a href='/Bibles/English---Aionian-Bible/Mark/9' title='Mark 9:41' onclick='return AionianBible_Makemark("/Bibles","/Mark/9");'>Mark 9:41</a>, <i>"For whoever will give you a cup of water to drink in my name because you are Christâ€™s, most certainly I tell you, he will in no way lose his reward."</i></p>
