<h2 class=center>Third Party Publisher Resources</h2>

<p>
Thank you for your interest in re-publishing Aionian Bible content.  The <span class='notranslate'>Aionian</span>  Bible is copyrighted with the <a href='https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0' target='_blank' title='Copyright license'>Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International</a> license allowing 100% freedom to copy, print, revise, and sell if allowed by the source text copyright. First, third party publishers are granted permission to distribute any unchanged Aionian Bible publication or file for free or commercially, except on or through any Amazon, Lulu, Ingram Spark, or Ingram Lightning Source platform or subsidiary which are our chosen commercial outlets. The  <i class='notranslate'>Holy Bible Aionian EditionÂ®</i>  trademark enforces this rule. Second, you are welcome to create derived works with complete freedom, though you must change the publication title, remove our trademark, and give attribution as follows, "Derived from AionianBible.org by Nainoia Inc." We also request that you give attribution to our original source and even consider deriving your new work directly from our source. The <span class='notranslate'>Aionian</span>  Bible does not require that your derived work include a ShareAlike copyright in order to allow future publishers greater copyright freedom, though again we request that future copyrights at least require attribution, <a href='https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0' target='_blank' title='Copyright license'>Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International</a>, so that the text lineage is documented. If you have any licensing questions <a href='/Publisher'>please ask</a>.

<B>Aionian Bible Content Management System (ABCMS):</B><BR />
The <i>Aionian Bible Content Management System</i> (ABCMS) also known as <i>A Basic Content Management System</i> is in production at <a href='https://www.AionianBible.com'>AionianBible.org</a>. The development philosophy of the first production release was simply to reliably publish as many Bibles as possible in as short a time as possible while being creative with approved programming practices as needed for expediency.  For example, we used lots of global variables, very carefully and without shame.  <a href='https://nainoia-inc.signedon.net/' target='_blank'>Nainoia Inc</a> believes that we are in a spiritual war-time status and we serve accordingly.  When duct tape worked and was at hand we did not run for the hammer and nails.  And with the Lord's help we have published many Bible translations in many languages both online and in print with a skeleton crew.  Having reached our first major milestone, Lord willing, we now plan to rewrite the content management system with the source code being available for comment, collaboration, and additional online applications.  And we have a cool plan for our global variables!  Watch our progress at <a href='https://github.com/Nainoia-Inc' target='_blank'>GitHub.com/Nainoia-Inc</a>.
