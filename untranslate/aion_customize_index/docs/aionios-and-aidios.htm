<p>The <span class='notranslate'>Aionian</span>  Bible republishes public domain and Creative Common Bible texts that are 100% free to copy and print. The original translation is unaltered and notes are added to help your study.  The notes show the location of eleven special Greek and Hebrew  <a href='/Glossary' title='Aionian Glossary'><span class='notranslate'>Aionian</span> Glossary</a>  words to help us better understand God’s love for individuals and for all mankind, and the nature of afterlife destinies.  The first three words are  <a href='/Glossary#g165' title='Aionian Glossary g165' onclick='return AionianBible_Makemark("/Glossary","#g165");'><i class='notranslate'>aiōn</i></a>,  <a href='/Glossary#g166' title='Aionian Glossary g166' onclick='return AionianBible_Makemark("/Glossary","#g166");'><i class='notranslate'>aiōnios</i></a>, and  <a href='/Glossary#g126' title='Aionian Glossary g126' onclick='return AionianBible_Makemark("/Glossary","#g126");'><i class='notranslate'>aïdios</i></a>,  typically translated as  <i>eternal</i>  and also  <i>world</i>  or  <i>eon</i>. Consider that researchers question if  <i class='notranslate'>aiōn</i>  and  <i class='notranslate'>aiōnios</i>  actually mean <i>eternal</i>. See below. Every quest for the truth must have the wisdom to eliminate what we prefer to be true and also the courage to eliminate what we fear to be true in order to discover what Christ says is actually true.</p>

She begins, "<i>The Greek word <span class='notranslate'>aiōn</span> has a wide ranging meaning as well as a  wide ranging history: it  is  most commonly translated as ‘eternity’ but has as its first meaning ‘life’ or ‘lifetime’; it has its place in Greek literature and philosophy, but also in the Greek Bible, where it represents the Hebrew word <span class='notranslate'>‘olâm</span>.</i>"  Her 315 page PhD dissertation shows that the Greek word <i class='notranslate'>aiōn</i> originally denotes <i>life time</i>, <i>duration,</i> or <i>complete life</i>, but not <i>eternal</i>.  You can read her <a href="/Life-Time-Entirety-Keizer" target="_blank">dissertation online</a> or an <a href="/Life-Time-Entirety-Keizer-Abstract" target="_blank">abstract of her conclusions here</a>.</p>
