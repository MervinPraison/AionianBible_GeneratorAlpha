<B>Aionian Bible Content Management System (ABCMS):</B><BR />
The <i>Aionian Bible Content Management System</i> (ABCMS) also known as <i>A Basic Content Management System</i> is in production at <a href='http://www.AionianBible.com'>AionianBible.org</a>. The development philosophy of the first production release was simply to reliably publish as many Bibles as possible in as short a time as possible while being creative with approved programming practices as needed for expediency.  For example, we used lots of global variables, very carefully and without shame.  <a href='http://nainoia-inc.signedon.net/' target='_blank'>Nainoia Inc</a> believes that we are in a spiritual war-time status and we serve accordingly.  When duct tape worked and was at hand we did not run for the hammer and nails.  And with the Lord's help we have published many Bible translations in many languages both online and in print with a skeleton crew.  Having reached our first major milestone, Lord willing, we now plan to rewrite the content management system with the source code being available for comment, collaboration, and additional online applications.  And we have a cool plan for our global variables!  Watch our progress at <a href='https://github.com/Nainoia-Inc' target='_blank'>GitHub.com/Nainoia-Inc</a>.

All Aionian Bible content is made publicly available under the <a href='https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0' target='_blank' title='Copyright license'>Creative Commons Attribution No Derivative Works 4.0</a> license for three reasons: 1) to enable third party distribution of the unaltered Aionian Bible publications, whether free or commercial, 2) to encourage further research in Bible texts, and 3) to release the Aionian Bible project content and the  <i class='notranslate'>Holy Bible Aionian Edition速</i>  trademark to the public domain in the case that Nainoia, Inc. or a future copyright holder becomes defunct.  Please feel free to archive copies of the entire project until then.  And finally because <i class='notranslate'>Holy Bible Aionian Edition速</i>  is a registered trademark it MAY NOT be used by any other entity except Nainoia Inc for commercial sales on the Amazon KDP, Lulu, and Ingram Lightning Source print on demand platforms which are our chosen outlets to sell these Bibles as inexpensively as possible.  Any questions please ask.
