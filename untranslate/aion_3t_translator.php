# STATEMENT
# 1. In one true God, existing eternally as one God in three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, John 14:9-21, who is in essence spirit, John 4:24, light, 1 John 1:5, and love, 1 John 4:8.
# 2. That the 66 books of the Old and New Testaments are the unique, inerrant, inspired Word of God in the original autographs, and the final authority in all matters of faith and conduct, 2 Tim 3:16.
# 3. In the sovereignty and active rule of God in creation, the fall, history, revelation, miracles, prophecy, redemption, and final judgment, Romans 8:20-21.
# 4. That man was created by God in His image, but that since Adam's fall, all men are sinful and by nature deserve God's wrath, Ephesians 2:3.
# 5. That Jesus is the only begotten Son of God, fully human and fully divine, eternally existing as God, yet born in time of a virgin, and that He lived a sinless and perfect life, 2 Timothy 2:5.
# 6. In the historic death of Jesus as the full and only atonement, guaranteeing loving forgiveness for the sins of all mankind, in His bodily resurrection from the dead, and in His ascension to the right hand of the Father, 1 John 2:1-2.
# 7. That all mankind is justified by the loving grace of God and redeemed on the basis of the death of Christ, which is received through faith, Ephesians 2:8-9.
# 8. That the Holy Spirit is the effective agent in regeneration, bringing individuals to faith and transformed lives, 2 Corinthians 3:18.
# 9. In one universal church, Christ’s Body, to which all believers belong, and in local churches accountable to God, lead by officers who govern local church belief and discipline, while respecting individual conscience, Hebrews 13:17, 1 John 2:27.
# 10. That believing mankind is rewarded in paradise after death, while unbelievers suffer punishment in Hades after death merited by their sinful nature and their rejection of the grace of Christ, Luke 16:19-31.
# 11. In the future, visible, physical return of the Lord Jesus Christ in glory, Titus 2:13.
# 12. In the final resurrection of redeemed mankind to the enjoyment of God forever, and the damnation of those excluded from the Book of Life to the Lake of Fire prepared for the Devil and his angels for the ages of the ages, Matthew 25:31-46 and Revelation 20:10.
# 13. This statement of Christian faith does not exhaust the extent of our beliefs. The Bible itself, as the inspired and infallible Word of God that speaks with final authority concerning truth, morality, and the proper conduct of mankind, is the sole and final source of all that we believe. For purposes of The Corporation’s belief the Board of Directors is The Corporation’s final interpretive authority on the Bible’s meaning and application.
#
# TRANSLATING:
# 1. Pray, recruit a committee of faithful Christians, and consider carefully your motives before departing from the above Statement of Faith.
# 2. Acknowledge that translations are not inspired and contain errors, through hopefully they are faithfully made, because only the original autographs of Scripture are God-breathed and without error.
# 3. Translate and do not paraphrase, prioritizing the contexts of phrase, sentence, paragraph, book, author, testament, Bible, and history.
# 4. Allow for cumbersome and ambigous translation when the original meaning is also uncertain.
# 5. Maintain the Holy Spirit's gender choice of words because male and female is wonderful gift from God and a reflection of His image, and Bibical roles for men and women are a cause for celebration, not apology.
# 6. Maintain word and phrase order when possible, allowing some reduced readability if needed to capture the emphasis of the original language.
# 7. Preserve word repetition and continuation (same theme different word) for a concordant translation as much as possible to help the reader appreciate the major and minor themes, structure, poetry, and nuance of the original.
# 8. Translate Abyssos, Geenna, Hadēs, Limnē Pyr, Sheol, and Tartaroō as distinct locations.
# 9. Translate aïdios as eternal and aiōn as age or eon.
# 10. Translate aiōnios as an adjective of aiōn, that is pertaining to the age, life, lifetime, entire, whole, or consummate, but not as eternal or infinite time.
#
# STATEGY:
# 1. Use http://AionianBible.org for study, parallel Bible text viewing, and extended strongs lexiconic entries.
# 2. Download https://github.com/STEPBible/STEPBible-Data for direct access to the STEPBBible data.
# 3. Install https://notepad-plus-plus.org or a text editor with REGEX for advanced text search and edits.
# 4. Use the Aionian Bible verse per line format of "3-digit-book-index	3-character-book-abbreviation	3-digit-chapter-number	3-digit-verse-number	verse-text".
# 5. Create a new translation editing the verse line containing "NEW:".
# 6. Add lines beginning with "#" for comments as needed.
# 7. Release your work as CC0 (public domain) or CC-BY (attribution) or CC-BY-SA (shared with copyright) and avoid CC-NC (no commercial) so Bibles can be sold.
# 8. Submit your new translation to AionianBible.org and other outlets for distribution.
# 9. Pray for a modern public domain translation in every language.
#
# FORMAT HEBREW: (Holy-Bible---[language]---AB-StudyPack.txt)
# Columns: Pointed, Accented, Morphology, Extended Strongs
# Indication of Ketiv or Qere reading.
# 	The Qere is the scribal version in the margin.
#	Ketiv is the version found in the main text (if it is unpointed, the pointed version has been produced by Westminster and occasionally corrected by Tyndale scholars).
#	Most translations follow the Qere. 
# Word
#	Pointed form.
#	Accented forms from Westminster Leningrad text WLC 4.20 via OpenScriptures occassionally corrected towards the Leningrad Codex by Tyndale scholars.
# Morphology is from ETCBC in the form defined by OpenScriptures at http://openscriptures.github.io/morphhb/parsing/HebrewMorphologyCodes.html#vt
#	for the source of ETCBC and conversion method by Tyndale House, see https://goo.gl/yKaXQq#HebMorph2
#	ETCBC only parses the Qere. The Ketiv versions have been parsed by Tyndale scholars - see e.g. Deu.33.2-15
# Extended Strongs numbers are augmented (with additions of "a", "b" etc) in line with BDB based on OpenScriptures
#	and extended into the 9000s to include prefixes & suffixes - as in TBESH - Translators Brief lexicon of Extended Strongs for Hebrew at https://STEPBible\.github.io/STEPBible-Data/
#	§numbers represent submeanings within the Strongs number,  added by Tyndale scholars (not fully checked)
#	§names represent unique names for people, places and other proper nouns such as months etc.
#	as in TIPNR - Translators Individualised Proper Names with all References at https://STEPBible\.github.io/STEPBible-Data/

#	=NA same TR	133304 words are translated in both traditional KJV and modern Bibles.		NA27/28 + TR + others all having the same meaning				
#	=NA diff TR	3922 words may translate differently in traditional and modern Bibles.		NA27/28 + others having the same meaning but there are.also .. 				| Variants = different meanings in TR + others
#	=NA not TR	761 words are translated in most modern Bibles but not in the KJV.			NA27/28 + others having the same meaning but not TR				
#	=TR+NIV/ESV not NA	227 words are translated in the KJV and in some modern Bibles.		TR + others having the same meaning but not NA27/28				
#	=TR not NA,NIV/ESV	3573 words are translated in the KJV but not in most modern Bibles.	TR + others having the same meaning but not NA27/28				
#	Not in NA or TR	245 words occur in early manuscripts but not translated in most Bibles.	Others having a word that is not found in TR or NA27/28				
# Greek:
#	spelling based on NA28 for NA, then TR if not in NA, then other Eds if in neither.
#	Cases and final accents based on the punctuation which follows THGHT
# English:
#	is based on Berean Study Bible, with permission, as at 1-July02019.
#	This covered only NA words.
#	Others supplied by Tyndale scholars, and the complete work was unified in many ways. 
# Extended Strong:
#	Extended with words not used in the KJV.
#	Backwardly compatible with standard Strongs and NASB tagging, as defined in the Brief Lexicon at https://STEPBible\.github.io/STEPBible-Data/
# Morphology:

#	those which use the same letters, though they may be accented or capitalised differently.
#	Byz=Byzantine based on RP;
#	NA27=Nestle-Aland 27th ed;
#	NA28 2012 (this is NOT the same as ECM Acts - see eg Act.1.10 ἐσθῆτι in ECM);

# Sub-meanings:
#	words with more than one meaning are supplied with a context-sensitive sub-meaning.
#	Individuals and Places are identified as in TIPNR.
#	Other are based on CSG (Context Sensitive Gloss) from Marvel Bible Project as at 9-Jan-2019
#	from https://github.com/eliranwong/OpenGNT/blob/master/OpenGNT_BASE_TEXT.zip & OpenGNT_keyedFeatures.csv.zip.
#	This was available only for words in NA28.
#	Other words are supplied by Tyndale House who also edited the CSG for words where sub-meanings  were not sufficiently detailed. 
# Conjoined data:
#	links words that might not be translated (eg articles and particles) with the word they are connected to, which are often separated by several other words.
