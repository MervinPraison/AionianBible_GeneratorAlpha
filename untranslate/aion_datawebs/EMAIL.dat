12/17/2017 21:12:09	160.3.52.42	James	jahiddle@gmail.com	Doesn't this verse refute universalism? 1 Chron 28:9 - You, Solomon my son, know the God of your father, and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind; for Yahweh searches all hearts, and understands all the imaginations of the thoughts. If you seek him, he will be found by you; but if you forsake him, he will cast you off forever.

(In 2012 he said he was interested in helping, so I put his name on it. Since he only did a few suggestions, and was not interested in editing, I removed his name the next year). Also, the "2009-2018" should read "2007-2018". Thank you! very much appreciated. Yours in the Messiah, Wayne Mitchell / Editor NHEB.

Thank you

10/17/2019 07:10:05	162.198.82.0	Dennis Dibben	lazshort@yahoo.com	This interests me due to the ongoing debate between the forever and ever crowd and the ages of ages crowd.  I have seen the bias and bad translation in the KJV, so this may be of interest to me.
11/06/2019 17:11:03	76.170.101.55	Rick	rick11171960@yahoo.com	You are very close. My finding is this. The word G165 can Only be translated in Every verse found, as “age”. The word G166 is an adjective, adding “lasting” to the root word of G165 “age”, thus correctly meaning “age lasting”. In Every verse where G166 is found, the word “age lasting” is always referring to the time period from the return of Christ, until final judgment, at which time all  of those in correction will be released from the grasp of death, and from the place of hades, and will be then be forgiven, and purified along with those of the first resurrection, by the fire that comes down from heaven, upon both, those inside the New Jerusalem, and those gathered around it.

03/27/2020 06:03:30	98.235.88.128	Jeff	jeff@dgjc.org	I understand that the Aionian Bible republishes public domain and Creative Commons Bible texts and that volunteers are needed to present the original text accurately.  I also understand that apocryphal text is removed and most variant verse numbering is mapped to the English standard. I have entered my corrections under the verse(s) below.

Proposed corrections to the Aionian Bible, John Chapter 3

1) Now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jewish people.

2) This man came to him at night, and said to him, "Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God, for no one can do these signs that you do, unless God is with him."

3) Jesus answered him, "Truly, truly, I tell you, unless one is born again he cannot see the Kingdom of God."

4) Nicodemus said to him, "How can anyone be born when he is old?  Can he enter a second time into his mother's womb, and be born?"

5) Jesus answered, "Truly, truly, I tell you, unless one is born of water and Spirit he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.

6) That which is born of the flesh is flesh.  That which is born of the Spirit is spirit.

7) Do not be surprised that I said to you, 'You must be born again.'

8) The wind blows where it wants to, and you hear its sound, but do not know where it comes from and where it is going.  So is everyone who is born of the Spirit."

9) Nicodemus answered and said to him, "How can these things be?"

10) Jesus answered him, "Are you the teacher of Israel, and do not understand these things?

11) Truly, truly, I tell you, we speak that which we know, and testify of that which we have seen, and you do not receive our witness.

12) If I told you earthly things and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things?

13) And no one has ascended into heaven, but he who descended out of heaven, the Son of Man, who is in heaven.

14) And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up,

15) that whoever believes in him may have consummate (aiōnios g166) life.

16) For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have consummate life. (aiōnios g166)

17) For God did not send his Son into the world to judge the world, but that the world should be saved through him.

18) He who believes in him is not judged.  He who does not believe has been judged already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God.

19) This is the judgment, that the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light; for their works were evil.

20) For everyone who does evil hates the light, and does not come to the light, lest his works would be exposed.

21) But he who does the truth comes to the light, that his works may be revealed, that they have been done in God."

22) After these things, Jesus came with his disciples into the land of Judea.  He stayed there with them, and baptized.

23) Now John also was baptizing in Aenon near Salim, because there was much water there.  They came, and were baptized.

24) For John was not yet thrown into prison.

25) Now a dispute arose between John's disciples with a Jew about purification.

26) And they came to John, and said to him, "Rabbi, he who was with you beyond the Jordan, to whom you have testified, look, he is baptizing, and everyone is coming to him."

27) John answered, "No one can receive anything, unless it has been given to him from heaven.

28) You yourselves bear me witness that I said, 'I am not the Messiah,' but, 'I have been sent before him.'

29) He who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom's voice.  So this joy of mine is now complete.

30) He must increase, but I must decrease.

31) He who comes from above is above all.  He who is from the earth belongs to the earth, and speaks of the earth.  He who comes from heaven is above all.

32) What he has seen and heard, of that he testifies; and no one receives his witness.

33) He who has received his witness has set his seal to this, that God is true.

34) For he whom God has sent speaks the words of God; for he does not give the Spirit by measure.

35) The Father loves the Son, and has given all things into his hand.

36) One who believes in the Son has consummate (aiōnios g166) life, but one who disobeys the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him."

07/04/2020 15:07:59	185.230.127.237	Stefan Undorf	el@softwarerero.com	Hello, I am looking for a better and cheaper solution than InDesign for printing various translation of a Swedish bible comment (https://sv.wikisource.org/wiki/Bibeln_(Fjellstedts_f%C3%B6rklaringar) in combination with bible texts. I have evaluated Speedata yesterday but my progress is slow. I have seen on their webpage that you have used it and your bible layouts look way better than what I have accomplished so far: http://softwarerero.com/SFB15-GEN.pdf Would you be willing to share an example data and layout file, this could maybe save me a lot of time. I have problems with:

- The spacing before and after paragraphs seems to be random and I have not found a way yet to control it.
- To render the page count the document has to be rendered twice and the code for it is ugly.
- Text flowing around images seems complicated and i haven't mastered it yet.
- There are widows and orphans and I see no easy way to avoid them.

Blessings,
Stefan

Thank Your very much for publishing Matupi Chin Standard Bible. As I am administrator of Matupi Chin Standard Bible committee I would like to correct your Browser Bible - Not Matu Chin Bible but it is Matupi Chin Standard Bible. Because we officially resisted as (MCSB).  

We MCSB committee translated Matupi Chin Standard Bible from original Hebrew and Greek text so we added strong numbers. And we translated DC version (Tobit, Judith, Esther Greek, Sriracha, Wisdom of Solomon, 1,2 Maccabees, 1Edras) if it possible we would like to publish DC Bible in online version.  

Thank You

May I ask if there are any copyright restrictions to creating an audio version of the Aionian  Bible? 

I would like to record it for my sons’ and others that may be interested. 

Do I need specific permissions to record it? Possibly to offer it  publicly for others to listen? 

In Christ.

devoured by me. After reading most New Testaments in study circumstances,I was profoundly influenced by what I perceived as a Spirit of the fear of God in its pages. It brought me to a powerful sense of my need for personal repentance. Since then I've owned and lost,or had removed from my library several different editions of the text in different bindings. By far the most helpful edition was a hardback copy with textual and commentary notes. Most profound! It's a great loss for the English Biblical student to have missed the opportunity to have his work to devour. Sincerely a lover of Jesus.
