# COLUMNS
#	STRONGS
#		These Extended Strong Numbers are mapped to BDB (and thereby to other modern lexicons) by OpenScriptures.org.
#		This adds about 800 words which are found in modern lexicons but were not differentiated by Strong.
#		Numbers beyond 9000 include non-lexical prefixes and suffixed. They were created by Tyndale House, Cambridge
#		They are designed to be backward compatible with software that uses Strongs numbers. 
#	WORD
#		Hebrew form	based on BDB, then normalised
#	TRANS
#		Transliteration
#	GLOSS
#		A meaning in one word or as few as possible (by Tyndale scholars)
#	MORPH
#		These were created by Tyndale scholars as a simple grammatical value of the main word represented as Language:Type-Gender-Extra. 
#		Language:Type-Gender-Extra.   Language is A=Aramaic, H=Hebrew, G=Greek and n+Name (which is not language specific). 
#		Type is A=Adjective, Adv=Adverb, Art=Article, Cond=Conditional, Conj=Conjunction, Cor=Correlative, DemP=Demonstrative Pn, ImpP=Impersonal Pn, Intg=Interogative,
#			Intj=Interjection, N=Noun, Neg=Negative, Part=Particle, Prep=Preposition, PerP=Personal Pn, PosP=Possessive Pn, RefP=Reflexive Pn, RelP=Relative Pn, V=Verb. 
#		Gender is F=Female, M=Male, N=Neuter, C=Common and P or S is optionally added for Plural Singular
#		Extra for Names is L=Location, P=Person, LG/PG=Gentilic, T=Title (i.e. any other capitalised nouns such as titles, months, gods, planets etc)
#
#		(notes re Morph)
#		Location is only used for places not named after people - eg: Israel = N:N-M-P (for the Person, and nation); Jerusalem = N:N--L; Canaanite is N:N-M-LG; Israelitess is N:N-F-PG
#		Location is a geographical entity such as river, mountain or city eg "Dan", but Gentilic is used for Amon, Syria, Judah, or the tribal area of Dan. The idea is that someone from
#		Dan is probably related to Dan unless he is called a Hittite, but someone from Jerusalem or the city of Dan could be from anywhere even though he is named after the city.
#		So a "Shulemite" (who is prob from Salem ie Shalem aka Jerusalem) is dark-skinned and perhaps not a native from the area.
#		Title is a misc category that incl names of gods, musical term & months and offices such as Pharaoh unless referring to an individual eg Pharaoh Necho who is N:N-M-P
#		When F or M occ with L or T it refers to the gender of that person, not the location, so Jerusalem = N:N--L, Jerusalemites = N:N-G-L, Jerusalemitess = N:N-F-L 
#		When Gentilics related to a person the STEP_LexicalTag points to the Person eg Danites => Dan.  When Gentilics point to a place, the STEP_LexicalTag points to that place,
#		eg Gileadites => Gilead. When there is no numbered tag for the person or place, we probably aren't sure what it is, so the STEP_LexicalTag doesn't have anywhere different to point,
#		eg. Girgashites. Some very common Gentilics (eg Levite) have gained a meaning of their own which may be related to a person but much less so - so the STEP_LexicalTag does not
#		redirect to the entry for that person. 
#		Odd ones: Jew=N:N-G-P, Jewish=N:A, Jewess+Ammonitess=N:N-G-P-F, Canaanite-trader=N:N-G-P / N:N-G-T, Chaldean-magi=N:N-G-L / N:N-G-T,
#			Nephusim=N:N-G-T, Rephaim=N:N-G-P / N:N-G-T, Shulamite+Shunammite+Carmelitess+Jezreelitess=N:N-F-L
